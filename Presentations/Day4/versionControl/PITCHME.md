* The whole idea behind any **version control** system is to **store “safe” copies** of a project 
<br>
<br>

* You never have to worry about irreparably breaking your code base

* Nothing that is committed to version control is ever lost, unless you work really, really hard at it.
<br>
<br>

* All old versions of files are saved, it’s always possible to go back in time to see exactly who wrote what on a particular day, or what version of a program was used to generate a particular set of results.

* We’ve all been in this situation before: it **seems ridiculous to have multiple nearly-identical versions** of the same document.

* Some **word processors** let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft Word’s **Track** **Changes** or Google Docs’ **version** **history**.

* BUT if you use LibreOffice Writer or Microsoft Word, **what happens if you accept changes made using the Track Changes option? Do you have a history of those changes?**
---

* Version control systems start with a base version of the document

* Save just the changes you made at each step of the way

---

* For example, you can make independent sets of changes based on the same document.

You can decide which changes keep on the same base document
